# Arrays Intersection in Java

## 📌 Problem Statement
Write a Java program that takes **two sorted arrays** as input and finds their **intersection** (common elements).

---

## 🖥️ Program Description
- The program:
  1. Asks the user to input the size of the first and second arrays.
  2. Reads the elements of both arrays **in sorted order**.
  3. Uses a **two-pointer technique** to find the common elements.
  4. Prints the resulting intersection as an `ArrayList`.

- **Why sorted arrays?**  
  Since both arrays are sorted, we can use a linear scan (two-pointer method) instead of nested loops, making the solution more efficient.
